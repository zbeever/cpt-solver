# Charged Particle Trajectory Solver
Solver designed to calculate and plot the trajectory of charged particles in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. This is a WIP, with many features not yet implemented.

## Getting Started
Navigate to the project directory using the terminal and run the file with `python solver.py` The included code has comments that should make adding particles and changing the background fields self-explanatory.

## Prerequisites
You'll need Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.
